			<br>
			Blind Phoenix Brophy Prep running back Adonis Watt, whose story was chronicled by azcentral sports on Sept. 6, ran for two touchdowns in a freshman football game last week against Mesa Mountain View.
			<br>
			<br>
			The touchdown runs were from 1 and 3 yards and the Mountain View players were defending, Brophy freshman coach Scott Heideman said.
			<br>
			<br>
			"ALL EARNED!!," Heideman wrote in an email about Watt's touchdowns.
			<br>
			<br>
			In Watt's first high school football game, Gilbert Highland, realizing that Watt was blind, opened up its defense in the final minute to let Watt run for a 45-yard touchdown.
			<br>
			<br>
			"We didn't even tell the officials this game," Heideman said.
			<br>
			<br>
			Watt doesn't want to be given any freebies in life. He wants to earn everything on the field.
			<br>
			<br>
			And how did he feel afterwards about earning those TDs?
			<br>
			<br>
			"Adonis in his typical tone, 'Felt good,' like no big deal,'' Heideman said. "He makes me forget every day that he can't see."
