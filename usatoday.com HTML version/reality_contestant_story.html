			</div>
			<p>Bravo reality TV contestant Grant William Robicheaux was arrested and accused of drugging and raping at least two women in Newport Beach, California, according to the Orange County District Attorney. 
			<br>
			<br>
			And investigators believe there could be many more victims.
			<br>
			<br>
			The 38-year-old orthopedic surgeon and girlfriend Cerissa Laura Riley, 31, were both charged with rape by use of drugs and oral copulation by anesthesia or controlled substance, among other felony charges.
			<br>
			<br>
			Robicheaux appeared on the short-lived dating show "Online Dating Rituals of the American Male," which aired in 2014 for one season, where he was looking "to find the perfect woman, have a fantasy wedding and raise the All-American family."
			<br>
			<br>
			Bravo has since removed all clips of Robicheaux from its site, including the episode he appeared on. The district attorney's office said the segment was called "Three's a Crowd."

			<br>
			<br>
			The first sexual assault allegedly took place in April 2016, after the couple met a woman at a restaurant in Newport Beach and invited her to a boat party. The suspects then escorted the intoxicated woman to Robicheaux's home, where she was raped, according to authorities. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In October 2016, Robicheaux and Riley are accused of taking a woman who "was no longer conscious" back to the surgeon's apartment with intentions to rape her after drinking with the victim at a bar, police say. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The second known victim woke up while being sexually assaulted and screamed for help, according to investigators. Police responded and the investigation into the couple began. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"Women who encountered these two might have felt a false sense of security due to the fact that both defendants are clean-cut and good-looking," Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said during a press conference Tuesday. "We tend to trust doctors who take an oath to do no harm. … A woman purporting to be his girlfriend clearly played a significant role in disarming the victims."
			<br>
			<br>
			Rackauckas believes there are more victims out there after reportedly finding "thousands and thousands of video and images" of potential victims on Robicheaux's phones.

			<br>
			<br>
			"There are several videos where the women ... appear to be highly intoxicated beyond the ability to consent or resist," the DA said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Both Robicheaux and Riley have been released on bail, and their attorneys say they “unequivocally” deny the allegations of nonconsensual sex.
			<br>
			<br>
			If convicted, Robicheaux faces up to 40 years in prison and Riley could spend up to 30 years and eight months in prison.
			<br>
			<br>
			They are due in court in late October.
