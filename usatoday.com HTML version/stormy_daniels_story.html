			<p>Late-night hosts had a field day thanks to adult-film star Stormy Daniels' memoir "Full Disclosure," in which she describes President Trump's genitals.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the memoir, due Oct. 2, Daniels explains her claim that she slept with President Donald Trump in 2006, why she decided to sign a $130,000 hush agreement in the days preceding Trump's 2016 election and why she later decided to go public with her story.
			<br>
			<br>
			The detail that had Jimmy Kimmel and other others laughing the most, however, was Daniels' comment that Trump's genitals look like the mushroom-shaped video game character Toad from Mario Kart.
			<br>
			<br>
			"And just like that, I will not eat a mushroom or play a video game ever again," the "Jimmy Kimmel Live" host joked during Tuesday's episode.
			<br>
			<br>
			He added, "She describes Trump's penis as smaller than average but admitted she was impressed it had his name embossed in gold on it."
			<br>
			<br>
			Seth Meyers expressed his shock and disgust over Daniels' description. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"For once, I'm going to say let's not take a closer look. That's a joke about the news," he said. "You might be saying, how dare you make a joke about a penis looking like a video game character? That's the (expletive) news right now."
			<br>
			<br>
			He continued, "My head's not in the gutter. It's in the news, which is in the gutter."
			<br>
			<br>
			Jimmy Fallon also joked about the description of "Trump's Tower," saying "(that) explains why every book comes with a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and a straw."
			<br>
			<br>
			"People are like, 'Forget the shape, how does he explain the giant red dots?' " he said after showing a picture of the video game characters, whose head is white with red dots. "That's what I'd be worried about."
			<br>
			<br>
			Fallon continued, "That's why in the new Mario Kart, Toad collects gold coins and uses them as hush money."
			<br>
			<br>
			James Corden also joined in on the jokes, saying "this is awful."
			<br>
			<br>
			"It's not enough that Trump has ruined reality for most of us, he's now ruining video games," he joked before taking aim at Vice President Mike Pence. "(He) didn't really get the reference, he's never played Mario Kart because it features a woman driving."
