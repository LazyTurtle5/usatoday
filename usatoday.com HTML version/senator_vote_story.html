Bob Corker, R-Tenn., comments on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid scrutiny of a woman's claim he sexually assaulted her at a party when they were in high school, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Sept. 18, 2018.</span>
			</div>
			<p>WASHINGTON – Two Republican senators who this week said they would be hesitant to proceed with a vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh until they had a chance to hear from a woman accusing him of sexual assault are strongly encouraging the accuser to appear at a scheduled hearing next week.
			<br>
			<br>
			Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., both called for a delay on Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, which had been scheduled for Thursday, after Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford came forward publicly as Kavanaugh's accuser in The Washington Post over the weekend.
			<br>
			<br>
			Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tried to arrange phone calls with Kavanaugh and Ford to discuss the allegation and eventually agreed to schedule a public hearing on Monday with both parties invited to testify. But Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, has since said that her client wants an FBI investigation into the alleged incident before testifying.  
			<br>
			<br>
			On Wednesday, Grassley sent a series of tweets in which he said "Ford shouldn't be threatened or insulted," that she "deserves to be heard" and that he expects his "colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be respectful & treat the situation with the sensitivity it deserves."
			<br>
			<br>
			But he also dismissed the calls for an FBI investigation. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Grassley said committee investigators are "following up on the leads from Dr. Ford's allegations" and "no other OUTSIDE investigation is necessary." 
			<br>
			<br>
			Ford alleges Kavanaugh held her down and tried to remove her clothes at a party when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh has strongly denied the accusation. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Corker said in a tweet early Wednesday that Grassley "took immediate action to ensure both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have the opportunity to be heard, in public or private."
			<br>
			<br>
			"Republicans extended a hand in good faith," he said. "If we don't hear from both sides on Monday, let's vote." 
			<br>
			<br>
			Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who sits on the Judiciary Committee, strongly urged Ford to accept the Senate's invitation to speak on Monday. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"When Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It did so," Flake said in a tweet Wednesday. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday in a public or private setting. The committee should hear her voice." 
			<br>
			<br>
			President Donald Trump also indicated he hopes Ford attends Monday's scheduled hearing. 
			<br>
			<br>
			"I really would want to see what she has to say," Trump said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			He also said Democrats are "hurting somebody’s life very badly" with the allegation against Kavanaugh.
